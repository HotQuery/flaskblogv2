# Design Diary Prompt
Design diary: 2/14/2020


This project was challenging in the ways that we discussed in class on Wednesday, primarilly in that I have never coded in python before, or used VS code, HTML, flask, or had much experiencing with the processes that occur with virtual environments in powershell. Because of this, and also due to having an extremely hectic last couple weeks, I am not as satisified with this project as I would like to be. 

This project allowed me to better conceptualize the web-building process,and I felt like that was one of the most enjoyable aspects of it. The challenges that came with understanding how a server communicates information to the host and back are things that I now know slightly more about, but still feel like I could spend more time fully understanding. 

Due to the large amount of new technologies I was interacting with at once, it was hard for me to operate effectively on the actual project while simulatenously trying to learn new multiple interactions and requirements, but I did enjoy figuring out how these pieces come together, such as @app.route's communication between different html code and the server. 

Meeting with my project buddies was useful for asking questions and getting the structure of this project organized, but I still have many questions about how different functions are interacting with eachother.

Overall I just wish I had more time to work on this project, and I do feel like I learned a good deal on it. Having to move this week unexpectedly has impacted the time I've had for schoolwork as well.
