# Buddy Report
Give your honest appraisal of each of your buddies' progress:

Both my buddies, Peter and Greyson, seemed to put in a lot of work on their projects, and we spent multiple hours together on Tuesday at the lab working on our sites. They seemed less stuck than I was as they were more experienced with the apps we were using, and they were able to share a lot of information that made understanding this process easier. They were able to answer many questions I had about markdown and HTML, as well as powershell commands and interactions, how to set up a virtual environment, and more. 

Peter Report: Peter helped me a lot on Tuesday at the lab, and in particular he helped me import files from github through powershell, set up virtual environments, and organize my code for the project. Peter also helped me troubleshoot issues I had with functionality of the login page, and adding an edit page.

Greyson Report: I interacted with Greyson less on our second meet up, but on our first meeting he was very helpful with questions I had about what exactly flask is and does, and he seemed focused on his project an stretch goals while we worked together.

* Did they seem like they gave a good, honest effort?  
* Did they get stuck somewhere?
* What ideas were shared / what was discussed during your interactions?
* What did you learn from them?
* Anything else you want to add.

A report for each buddy only needs to be a paragraph.  This Buddy Progress Report is _*in no way*_ connected to your Buddy's grade.  It is, however, tied to your grade so be sure to provide an accurate report!
